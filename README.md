# Deep Learning Curriculum

This repository has my solutions to the [Deep Learning Curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton) from Jacob Hilton. It is a result from Condor XL, a Condor Initiative program to upskill in Deep Learning and AI safety. I did all the readings and discussed them with a group of colleagues, then implemented the code exercises.
